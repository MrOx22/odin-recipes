During this project I will be creating a basic recipe website using all the knowledge I've gathered so far.
I will be using HTML to write the code for the website.
I may be inserting anchored hyperlinks, images, or even creating lists to achieve this.
I will structuring my sites using all I have learned e.g <> attributes with values =.
Attributes such as <strong> and <em> may be used to add importance and emphasis.
